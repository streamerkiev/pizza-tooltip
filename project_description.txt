The aim of this project was to create a plugin able to evenly allocate hotspots on a circle
(represented by pizza) depending on a number of text pieces passed to the plugin initialization.
Each hotspot has a tooltip with relevant text piece. These tooltips position depending on hotspots
positions (quarters of pizza), e.g. if the hotspot is placed in the bottom-right quarter, the
tooltip should form on the top-left corner of the hotspot. Tooltips also have mobile view as part of
responsive version of the plugin - when browser window is resized to mobile view, tooltips are shown in
a special area under the pizza. When browser window is resized back to desktop view, tooltips are
shown back as usual.

Plugin accepts arguments as options, so the first tooltip may be open on load or not, only one
tooltip can be opened at once or any number of them, preloader may be switched on or off (plugin
loads only after pizza image is loaded), fancy load can be switched on or off. Fancy load assumes
creating all hotspots in the center of pizza and their further animated allocation on a circle of pizza.

To demonstrate plugin functionality and allow manipulations with it from front page, Options block
was added. It is deactivated while plugin is loaded or reloaded and becomes active when plugin
is ready to be manipulated. Options block is an accordion with 3 sections. First section allows
to add one or several circles (hotspots). The second section allows to remove a certain hotspot
by it's number - to count counterclockwise we use a positive number, to count clockwise - a negative
number. The third section allows to reload plugin with custom text pieces separated with semicolon
for each hotspot and with custom options.
